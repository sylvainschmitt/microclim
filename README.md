**microclim** is a sub-project of the first article from Vincyan
Badouard’s PhD. The objective are:

- Data cleaning
- Spatio-temporal exploration of the data
- Choice and computation of metrics

## Project

**microclim** includes all codes to access the data (in `data/`) &
analyse the data (`files.qmd`) with associated [documentation and
figures](https://sylvainschmitt.github.io/microclim/). Intermediary
files and outputs can be accessed in `outputs/`. The project takes
advantage of `renv` to manage the R environment for enhanced
reproducibility.

## Contribution

You can contribute to the project by forking the repository on github
and cloning the fork to your machine using several options, including
GitHub desktop GUI. Access to the data is limited and can be requested
by emailing people from the core group (see below). Further informations
on contribution are detailed in the online document:
